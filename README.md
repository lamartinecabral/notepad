## FAQ:

**Q.** **Does this app collect my personal data?**

**A.** Only the note's content is stored in the database, nothing more.

**Q.** **Is there a way to protect my notes?**

**A.** Yes, if you want you can add a password to your note. Just click `password` in the upper right corner. Keep in mind that ***the password is used for authentication, not encryption***.

**Q.** **I would like to make my note read-only, is that possible?**

**A.** Yes, just do the following: add a password, click `options` in the upper right corner, check "protected", then check "public".

**Q.** **I forgot my note's password. How to restore the access to my note?**

**A.** The password feature is meant to be as simple as possible. Because of that, there's no way to recover or change the note's password. So be careful. Alternatively, go to https://nopedat.web.app/account/ and create an account. It's access is restorable as long as you have access to your e-mail. With and account you can claim notes as yours.

**Q.** **Can I claim any note as mine?**

**A.** You can only claim notes that are not protected and not claimed by anyone else.
